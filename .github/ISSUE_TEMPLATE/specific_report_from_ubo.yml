        To avoid burdening volunteers with invalid issues:
        - Force an update of [your filter lists](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists).
            - The fix to an issue might already be in the latest version of the lists.
            - This is especially important for a new installation of uBO.
        - Using too many filter lists increases likelihood of filter issues on websites.
            - You may be asked to verify that the issue still occurs when using only [default filter lists](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/585534/91296476-ab9d8c00-e76a-11ea-9fb9-87d6861bdf73.png).
        - Do not use another content blocker along uBO.
            - You need to verify that the issue still occurs when using only uBO.
            - Some browsers have a built-in content blocker which may be causing the issue.
